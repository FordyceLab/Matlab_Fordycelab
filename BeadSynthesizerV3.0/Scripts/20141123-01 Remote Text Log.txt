Starting again on Sunday at 1:00P.
Not sure if all formulations are as good as Friday, but going for it anyway.  Main suspect one is Dy... 
Had to keep formulations on chip after the last run and that caused Dy and CeTb to aggregate to some extent in the tubing 
and on the chip at their inputs. 
The aggregation did not extend back into the bulk formulation.

Looks good, but I'm leaving at Code 2, so anything can happen!  

GAME ON!

12:38A and Code 133.  Looks good so far...
