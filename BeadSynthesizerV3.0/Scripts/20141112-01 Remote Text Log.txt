Hi Brian,

Figured I'd lurk in on TeamViewer for old time's sake..  Code #8 and everything is still looking good - no puckering :)

Hah!  So cool to see you in my ghetto chat room!
Code 194 and still going!

Hopefully all formulations have held up and been in ample supply.

Hells yeah - code #275 and still looking good.  Awesome awesome awesome.

Cool.  Looks done.  Time for a quick flush (and to reboot MatLAB, it has a bug now that kills the program whenever
 a script finishes...)
