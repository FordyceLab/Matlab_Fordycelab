Checking in for the 20141121-01 batch.  Code 77 at 11:40P and no flow when drops are a go..
Too bad can't adjust scope x,y from home to look at chip...

I stopped it since droplets aren't flowing.  No idea what's going on. 
Will check on Sunday and if formulations are still good, I'll restart the chip.  

Bummer!

I left lab at Code #12 and was looking fine.

If I can find my way into SF tomorrow, I'll try to unclog the jam and restart after looking at the formulations and 
figuring out what exactly went wrong on the chip.

Sucks.  Tonight's score: Beads 0, Process Failure: 1.  

Thanks for playing!!!
